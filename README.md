# Spam/Ham Model

The goal of the project was to find features for a logistic regression model that classifies whether an email is spam or not. Content analysis was done on a set of spam and non-spam emails to identify any notable features. Examples of features include number of words, punctuation, and whether an email had certain keywords. After applying features, the model was able to correctly label 98.8% of emails, a 23.2% improvement over a logistic model with simple features.
